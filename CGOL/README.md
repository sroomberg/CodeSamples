# Conway's Game of Life (CGOL)

### CGOL Description
	CGOL is a cellular automaton devised by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

### CGOL Rules
	1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
	2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
	3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
	4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
